Recently I was exploring ways to work with pattern matching in Rust - using a small
relatable example that many people may have come across during technical interviews or in
online code challenges.

The problem is as follows: given a string input, determine if parenthesis, brackets and braces
are 'balanced'.

That it to say that any occurrence of `(` must eventually be followed by its closing partner `)`.

For example, `()` would be balanced, as would `(1+2)`. If the closing paren is missing however, then
it's not balanced, such as `(1-3`.

The rule holds true for the other 2 pairs, so this *is* balanced `([{123}])` because each pair is closed
before another is opened, but `(])` is NOT balanced because `]` has no opener.

## First, a stack-based approach

Given my background in Web programming, I was not immediately thinking about the most efficient implementation
in Rust, but rather I was focussing on the pattern-matching syntax and this is what I came up.

<Highlight src={require("raw-loader!../../rust/stack_original.rs").default} lang={"rust"} />

In Big O Notation we'd say this has a time complexity of O(n) since our worst case scenario is that we'd
have to access every single char once (looping all the way through the string).

The `stack` will grow & contract slightly as elements are added/removed.

### Dropping the nested `match`

I shared my first attempt on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shaneOsbourne/status/1385711012893057030?s=20), asking for help from fellow Rust developers since the nested
`match` just felt *wrong*

There were a number of extremely helpful responses (see the tweet/thread), my favourite of which
shows how the arms in Rust's `match` expressions can be followed by an optional **guard**.

```rust
///
/// Without a guard - the first match
/// arm here just has 3 patterns.
///
match c {
    '(' | '[' | '{' => { /* omitted */ },
    _ => {}
}
```

In that example, we say the first match arm has 3 `patterns` and we know where they end due to the `=>`. That is to say that
everything to the *left* of the `=>` is any number of patterns - it's then followed on the *right* by the expression to be executed if a match
is found on this arm.

### Adding a guard

Notice in the following example how the `if stack.pop() != Some(c)` is placed *before* the `=>` and from what we just learned above
we know that means it's not the expression to be executed *after* a match. It's actually there as part of the matching and even allows
mutation of the stack.

```rust
///
/// With a guard.
///
match c {
//   Patterns           MatchArmGuard
// ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓  ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
  ')' | ']' | '}' if stack.pop() != Some(c) => return false,
  _ => {}
}
```

## Putting it together

The full algorithm looks like this now, and although the Match Guard here doesn't
save that much (the `if` could be inside the block instead), it's usefulness becomes apparent
when you realise that you can have match guards on multiple arms.

## Stack-based solution Visualization

In this visualization you can clearly see how we only have a single pointer (representing the loop) - the stack
grows/shrinks as comparisons are made.

<DemoBlock label="stack-based visualization">
  <BrowserComponent kind="vanilla" scriptInclude="algo/algo-balanced-stack.lit.ts">
    <algo-balanced-stack
      input="((9+1))"
      inputs='[
  { "value": "((9+1))", "label": "Simple balanced" },
  { "value": "(1+2", "label": "Stack not empty" },
  { "value": "((1+2]", "label": "Closing bracket does not match" }
]'
    />
  </BrowserComponent>
</DemoBlock>

## Recursive solution

Whilst my original call for help on Twitter was not directly asking for more efficient solutions, I still got
a fair few people recommending a recursive solution to avoid the overhead of the `Vec<char>`.

The idea is that for this particular problem you can solve it with similar time complexity O(n) but without
having to allocate memory for the `Vec` and therefore dropping all the behind-the-scenes book-keeping needed for
`Vec`'s, like bounds & capacity checking. It was noted too, that a recursive solution [is more flexible](https://twitter.com/yyyypoi/status/1385850806922932226?s=20)

<Highlight src={require("raw-loader!../../rust/recursive.rs").default} lang={"rust"} />

Here we've introduced a second function `expect`, which is where the recursion will occur.

We kick it off with the initial call to `expect` from inside `balanced`, providing `None` as the end comparison (the thing we try
to match when we've seen an opener) and creating a mutable iterator of chars.

Each call to `expect` will end up in the `loop` and 1 char at a time will be accessed from the input. If an opening
brace/paren/bracket is found then the function is called again with the remainder of the input.

For the example `(1+2)` you can visualize the call stack like this

```shell
calls to 'expect'
    1: end: None, input: "(1+2)"
    1.1 input.next() = "("
        2: end: Some(")"), input: "1+2)"
        2.1 input.next() = "1"
        2.2 input.next() = "+"
        2.3 input.next() = "2"
        2.4 input.next() = ")"
        2.5 return compare Some(")") == Some(c)
```

Notice that on the very first call because `(` is matched, it means we immediately descend into a recursive call.
If the input string did not begin with an *opener* then we'd keep consuming chars first.

For the input `123()` the call stack would look like

```shell
calls to 'expect'
    1: end: None, input: "123()"
    1.1 input.next() = "1"
    1.2 input.next() = "2"
    1.3 input.next() = "3"
    1.4 input.next() = "("
        2: end: Some(")"), input: ")"
        2.1 input.next() = ")"
        2.2 return compare Some(")") == Some(c)
```

## Recursive solution, visualization

The recursive calls are modelled here as extra pointers (highlighted with different colours) - but
the most important thing to note here is the absence of any additional data structures.

<DemoBlock label="recursive visualization">
  <BrowserComponent kind="vanilla" scriptInclude="algo/algo-balanced-recursive.lit.ts">
    <algo-balanced-recursive
      input="(1+2)"
      inputs='[
  { "value": "(1+2)", "label": "Simple balanced" },
  { "value": "(1+2", "label": "Missing closing paren" },
  { "value": "({123}]", "label": "Closing does not match" },
  { "value": "]123", "label": "Starting on a closing" }
]'
    />
  </BrowserComponent>
</DemoBlock>

## Which is 'better'?

These 2 examples solve the same problem, but the recursive solution (especially in a language like Rust) seems to have
more benefits. The only advantage to the stack-based approach that I can think of is the easier learning curve.

Either way, talking about and creating visualizations of both has helped me develop a feeling for how I can make
more posts like this, perhaps going over common interview-style questions. Showing their implementations in Rust along with
animations.
