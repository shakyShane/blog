It's time to implement another well-known algorithm in Rust - this week's choice is Binary Search.

As always, this post will aim to highlight idiomatic Rust patterns, as well as provide interactive
visualizations.

## Binary search

The purpose of this algorithm is to determine if a given search value exists in a sorted array. You
can read more about it on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) and
I've also created the following visualization to go with it:

<DemoBlock label="binary search visualization">
    <BrowserComponent kind="vanilla" scriptInclude="algo/algo-binary-search.lit.ts">
        <algo-binary-search input="[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]" search="2" />
    </BrowserComponent>
</DemoBlock>

## First Attempt in Rust

As you can see from above, the implementation I chose uses a `high` and `low` cursor that begin
at either end of the array. We then enter a `while` loop and find the `middle` point each time
which is compared to the search target.

Each time that comparison is made we decide 1 of 3 things:

- if `middle` matches the search target, we're done
- if `middle` is *lower* than the search target, we discard **everything** before it, halving the list. We then move our
    `low` cursor to the start of the remainder of the list
- likewise, if `middle` is *higher* than the search target, everything after it is discarded and the `high` cursor
    moves to the relevant place.

So this was my attempt:

<Highlight src={require("raw-loader!../../rust/binary_search.original.rs").default} lang={"rust"} />

Seasoned Rust developers may notice something that I totally over-engineered here, mostly because of my
background in JavaScript, let's take a look.

## A couple of fixes...

### Fix 1: Removing the call to `floor`

Part of this algorithm requires you to continuously find the mid-point between your remaining items - this becomes
the new 'middle'. We do this by adding the high + low values, and then dividing by 2. so if `high=5` and `low=0`, then its
`(5 + 0) / 2 = 2.5`.

The issue here is that we need to use a whole number to perform the next lookup. We can't do
`items.get(2.5)` as this just doesn't make any sense.

In a higher-level language, such as JavaScript, you would prevent index access with a none-integer
by manually the flooring value after the division:

```js
// Safe to use in an index access
const middle = Math.floor((high + low) / 2);
````

Which is what I originally tried to replicate in Rust, with the following:

```rust
fn binary_search() {
    // snip...
    let middle = (((high + low) / 2) as f64).floor() as i32;
    // snip...
}
```

Not only did it look gross - it even *felt* wrong to me when I wrote it.

I was using my JavaScript implementation as reference, but converted to Rust it just seemed overly complex.

So as always I reached out to the Twitter/Rust community and thanks to a reply by the ever-helpful
[Basile Henry](https://twitter.com/basile_henry), I realised that in Rust this flooring is not actually
needed at all.

Division in Rust is achieved with the [`Div`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/ops/trait.Div.html#impl-Div%3Ci32%3E) trait,
and as the documentation states...

```rust
impl Div<i32> for i32 {
    // This operation rounds towards zero,
    // truncating any fractional part of the exact result.
}
```

... and since in my original example the `high` and `low` variables were both of type `i32` - this means that
a division between those 2 primitives would need to yield a value of the same type. To make this possible, the implementation
`i32 / i32` performs the flooring automatically. Nice.

Annotated with the type for clarity, the before and after would look like this

```rust
fn binary_search() {
    // before
    let middle: i32 = (((high + low) / 2) as f64).floor() as i32;
    // after
    let middle: i32 = (high + low) / 2;
}
```

### Fix 2: less casting by using `usize` for cursors

Our example is searching for an `i32` in a slice of `i32`'s - but the mistake I made here
was also using `i32` values as the high and low cursors.

I had `let mut low: i32 = 0` and `let mut high: i32 = items.len() as i32 - 1;` which forced me to cast to a `usize` when looking up
each `middle` value since `.get()` needs a type that's a valid index, such as `usize`.

```rust
fn binary_search(k: i32, items: &[i32]) {
    // before:
    //   cast needed to `usize` since `middle` is `i32`
    let mut low: i32 = 0;
    let mut high: i32 = items.len() as i32 - 1;
    if let Some(current) = items.get(middle as usize) {

    }

    // after:
    //   when middle is `usize` it's a valid index,
    //   so no casting is required
    let mut low: usize = 0;
    let mut high: usize = items.len() - 1;
    if let Some(current) = items.get(middle) {

    }
}
```

That's a straight-forward change that further cleans up the code, removing another number conversion - but it
comes with a slight trade off, explained in the next fix.


### Fix 3: ensure `usize` stays above zero

Whilst it's more `idomatic` to use the `usize` number type as cursors in our example, we need to ensure we don't
decrement any of them below zero, otherwise we'll get a runtime panic:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_usize() {
    let mut n: usize = 0;
    n -= 1; // !!! thread panicked at 'attempt to subtract with overflow'
}
```

This happens because we've explicitly used an 'unsigned' integer number type - that's what the `u` stands for in `usize`. It means
it must be a positive integer at all times.

This is not as dangerous as it sounds, our binary search algorithm just needs a couple of extra checks: one before we decrement
the `low` cursor and one right at the beginning to ensure we have a none-empty slice to loop through in the first place.

```rust
// before:
//   if unchecked, this could cause
//   a runtime panic because `middle` is
//   now a `usize`
if *current > k {
    high = middle - 1 // <-- danger
}


// after:
//   if `middle` has reached zero, end
//   the algorithm altogether and prevent
//   the runtime panic
if *current > k {
    if middle == 0 {
        return None;
    }
    high = middle - 1
}
```


## Final solution

Putting everything together, we arrive at what I would call an 'idiomatic' Rust implementation. I would love
to hear of further suggestions/improvements though - so please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shaneOsbourne)
