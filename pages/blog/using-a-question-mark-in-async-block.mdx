What's wrong with the following function in Rust?

```rust
fn measure_cargo_toml() -> usize {
    let toml = std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml")?;
    toml.len()
}
```

Putting the conversation about whether this is an optimal way to read a file's byte length to one side,
let's take a look.

`std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml")` returns `Result<String, io::Error>` so
we tried to use the question mark operator `?` to 'unwrap' the `String` that we really care about.

We're faced with the following error however:

```basic {"errorLines": [0, 1]}
cannot use the `?` operator in a function that returns `()`
this function should return `Result` or `Option` to accept `?`
```

This is suggesting that the `?` is doing a bit more than simply 'unwrapping' a value -
why's it mentioning the return types at all?

To understand, let's try to unwrap that `String` value a couple of other ways

### if let Ok(..)

If we only ever cared about the success case, then technically we could have done the following instead:


```rust {"attentionLines": [1, 4]}
fn measure_cargo_toml() -> usize {
    if let Ok(toml) = std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml") {
        toml.len()
    } else {
        0
    }
}
```

Notes:

- 1) we're performing a pattern-match on the return value from `read_to_string` here. The code within the
`if` block will only execute if the pattern `Ok(toml)` is a match against the result.
- 2) It looks like our design is breaking down here. To keep the type checker happy we're having to
use a 'default' value of `0` when the file reading fails. This is far from ideal since `0` could actually be a valid value,
but more so because it doesn't correctly encode what our function is capable of.

Rust can help us here though, we can use the type system to encode more meaning into our function signatures -
in this case the presence vs absence of a value can be communicated through the use of the `Option` enum.

If we change our return type to `Option<usize>`, then we can return a `None` in place of the `0` and
callers of this function will have a better understanding about how this works.


```rust {"attentionLines": [0, 2, 4]}
fn measure_cargo_toml() -> Option<usize> {
    if let Ok(toml) = std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml") {
        Some(toml.len())
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

Notes:
- 1) we changed the return type from `usize` to `Option<usize>`
- 2) because of that, we now need to wrap our return value in the `Some` variant
- 3) returning `None` here makes our program more explicit than the previous 'default' value of `0`

## That's a lot of boilerplate though...

Converting from `Result<T, _>` to an `Option<T>` is a fairly a common operation, and
the standard library comes with a `.ok()` method to help us reduce a bit of boilerplate:

```rust
pub fn measure_cargo_toml_02() -> Option<usize> {
    std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml") // Result<String, io::Error>
        .ok()                             // Option<String>
        .map(|toml| toml.len())           // Option<usize>
}
```

ðŸ¥° ahh, this kind of example is one of the reasons I enjoy Rust so much ðŸ¦€

---

But wait a minute - that's ignoring any errors that might occur when reading the file - what if we wanted
to handle that error by passing it on to callers, or even just logging out the error?

To do this, we need to think about our design again. Currently, our signature is this:

```rust
pub fn measure_cargo_toml() -> Option<usize> {
    // snip
}
```

We can produce a `usize` value, or not - that's it. Our design doesn't incorporate error
handling at all. So let's change that.

We can alter our return type to be the following instead:


```rust {"lines": [], "plusLines": [0], "attentionLines": []}
pub fn measure_cargo_toml() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    // snip
}
```

With this change, callers of our function will now be forced to handle the fact that our function can fail.
They may decide (as we did before) to ignore the error and use a default value, but at least this design
gives them that choice. `Option<usize>` loses all information if something goes wrong, and we don't want that.

So, to update our implementation to forward any errors, we can do the following instead:

** The re-wrapping method **

```rust {"attentionLines":[2,3]}
pub fn measure_cargo_toml() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    match std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml") {
        Ok(toml) => Ok(toml.len()),
        Err(err) => Err(err)
    }
}
```

- 1) When we match on the `Ok` variant, we get a local binding to the value contained inside, named `toml` here, then because *our* return
type is also a `Result`, we need to `Ok`-wrap the value we get from calling `toml.len()`
- 2) For the error case we're just re-wrapping the error since it matches our type `std::io::Error`

That's quite a bit of syntax and ceremony for what is essentially a 'change the value inside the box' operation though - but fear not,
Rust has yet more convenience methods to help with situations like this.

** The `.map()` method **

```rust {"attentionLines":[1,2]}
pub fn measure_cargo_toml() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    let result = std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml");
    result.map(|s| s.len())
}
```

Notes:
- 1) `read_to_string` returns `Result<String, std::io::Error>` - that's *very* close to what we want. The error part
matches our signature, but the value part does not.
- 2) To change *just* the value then, without explicitly unwrapping it, we
can use the `.map` method as seen here. This will only execute the closure on the value type if the result is of the `Ok` variant.
It's like opening a box, checking that everything inside is ok, then replacing the value and closing the box again.

So that's a couple of techniques that we can use to handle possible errors and read and return different values
where there are none.

## Understanding use cases for the `?` operator

So far though, our implementations have only contained 2 operations

- 1) read a file from disk into a string
- 2) return the amount of bytes that make up that string.

Because of this, we've been able to write a couple of different solutions that that didn't require much
more than 'reaching into a box' to change a value.

However, there are situations where this 'unwrapping' and 're-wrapping' of values is either tedious or just
completely overkill for the task at hand.

For example, if we changed our requirement to instead return the combined length from `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`, then we might
end up with a solution such as:

```rust {"lines": [], "attentionLines":[6, 10] }
pub fn main() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    let toml = read_to_string("Cargo.toml");
    let lock = read_to_string("Cargo.lock");
    let mut count = 0;
    match toml {
        Ok(str) => count += str.len(),
        Err(e) => return Err(e)
    }
    match lock {
        Ok(str) => count += str.len(),
        Err(e) => return Err(e)
    }
    Ok(count)
}
```

Notes:

- 1) + 2) Notice how we need to check each result independently so that we can return early if either
operation fails. We don't want to continue reading the second file if the first one has produced an error!

We can of course remove some of that duplication too using a `for in` loop:

```rust {"attentionLines": [7]}
pub fn main() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    let toml = read_to_string("Cargo.toml");
    let lock = read_to_string("Cargo.lock");
    let mut count = 0;
    for result in [toml, lock] {
        match result {
            Ok(str) => count += str.len(),
            Err(e) => return Err(e)
        }
    }
    Ok(count)
}
```

- 1) This is the key part - we're still returning early with an error should one occur.

Or, if you prefer a more functional approach, we can remove the loop and mutable variables with `try_fold`:

```rust {"lines": [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "attentionLines": [5, 8]}
pub fn main() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    let paths = ["Cargo.toml", "Cargo.lock"];
    paths
        .iter()
        .map(|path| std::fs::read_to_string(path))
        .try_fold(0, |acc, item| {
            match item {
                Ok(string) => Ok(acc + string.len()),
                Err(e) => Err(e)
            }
        })
}
```

Notes:

- 1) `try_fold` allows us to reduce a collection down to a single value, but with the added advantage of supporting early returns.
It works by continuing to call this closure every time the previous iteration returns an `Ok`.
- 2) For us that means that this line (2) would forward any errors coming from `read_to_string` - causing the `try_fold` to
stop iterating and return the error. That error it returns matches our function signature, so we can keep everything in a nice neat package
with no external variables to mutate.

## But...

Back to basics for a second here - in the examples above, we've taken the requirement of "read 2 files from disk and sum their
byte lengths" and we've ended up with a generic solution that can work with any amount of files.

Whether we choose a `for x in xs` loop, or a chain of iterator methods, we've still leap-frogged from simple -> complex in a heartbeat - is there
any middle-ground to explore?

** Enter `?`**

The core issue we're having here is the ergonomics around reaching into a `Result` type. Because `read_from_string` forces us
to deal with the fact that it can fail, it means we can't just access the values safely without a bit of syntax ceremony...

... but that's exactly what `?` (the question mark operator) is here to solve.

If we laser-focus in on *just* solving the 2-file problem, our solution could be as simple as:

```rust {"attentionLines":[3, 4]}
use std::fs::read_to_string;

fn measure_cargo_files() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    let toml = read_to_string("Cargo.toml")?;
    let lock = read_to_string("Cargo.lock")?;
    Ok(toml.len() + lock.len())
}
```

- 1) + 2) notice how on both of these lines, we add a `?` directly after the `read_to_string()` call. This will either 'unwrap' the
value (if it was successful), or it will return early with the error. Yep - exactly what we manually implemented earlier can be achieved
with that simple character.

## How it works: The error types line up!

This may seem like magic, but it's really just a case of our function signature having a return type that's
suitable for all places where we've used `?`.

So, our return type is:

```basic
Result<usize, std::io::Error>
```

whilst the return type of `read_to_string()` is

```basic
Result<String, std::io::Error>
```

The types of the values actually differ. Our return type has `usize` for the `Ok` case whereas `read_to_string` has `String`. But for the
`?` operator to work it's only the `Err` part that needs to line up.

The Rust compiler will analyze all uses of `?` within a function body and determine if each of them is suitable
for a possible 'early return' in your function.

A de-sugared version of `?` might look something like this:

```rust {"attentionLines": [5]}
use std::fs::read_to_string;

fn measure_cargo_files() -> Result<usize, std::io::Error> {
    let toml = match read_to_string("Cargo.toml") {
        Ok(_toml) => _toml,
        Err(err) => return Err(err)
    };
    // snip
}
```

- 1) yep, the `?` is just de-sugaring to an early-return like this, not so magical after all!


```basic
  |
6 |             return err;
  |                    ^^^ expected `()`, found struct `std::io::Error`
```


```rust {"attentionLines": [0]}
fn main() {
    let toml = std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml")?;
    println!("Cargo.toml has {} bytes", toml.len());
}
```
