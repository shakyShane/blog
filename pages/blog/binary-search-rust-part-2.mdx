This is a follow-up to the [original article](/blog/binary-search-rust) where I looked at a few ways
to improve my Rust implementation of Binary search - with a focus on removing 'mistakes'
and making it as 'idiomatic' as possible.

The most common piece of feedback I received on the result of the first article
was related to the comparison between the `middle` value and high/low cursors.

## Wasn't too far off

In my original Tweet (even before the first article) I had presented a variant of the algorithm
that used pattern matching for this comparison via Rust's `match` construct.

**One of my first attempts**

```rust
pub fn binary_search_alt(k: i32, items: &[i32]) -> Option<i32> {
    let mut low: i32 = 0;
    let mut high: i32 = items.len() as i32 - 1;

    while low <= high {
        let middle = (((high + low) / 2) as f64).floor() as i32;
        match items.get(middle as usize) {
            Some(current) if *current == k => return Some(middle),
            Some(current) if *current > k => high = middle - 1,
            Some(current) if *current < k => low = middle + 1,
            _ => {}
        }
    }
    None
}
```

If we apply the feedback from the [first article](/blog/binary-search-rust) to this implementation,
we'd end up with the following - which is just a bit cleaner since it removes some casting, and the manual
'flooring' I was originally doing.

```rust
pub fn binary_search_alt(k: i32, items: &[i32]) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut low: usize = 0;
    let mut high: usize = items.len() - 1;

    while low <= high {
        let middle = (high + low) / 2;
        match items.get(middle as usize) {
            Some(current) if *current == k => return Some(middle),
            Some(current) if *current > k => {
                if middle == 0 { return None };
                high = middle - 1
            },
            Some(current) if *current < k => { low = middle + 1; },
            _ => {}
        }
    }
    None
}
```

## The debate begins.

This is where it became a bit complicated - I originally received some feedback on Twitter
suggesting that because I'm not using the return value of the `match` block in any of the arms
and the fact I'm only using it to mutate the high/low cursors could possibly make this *not* idomatic Rust...

I fully understood the feedback at the time, and to rectify the match could be written like so:

```rust
match items.get(middle as usize) {
    Some(current) if *current == k => { return Some(middle); },
    Some(current) if *current > k => {
        if middle == 0 { return None };
        high = middle - 1;
    },
    Some(current) if *current < k => { low = middle + 1; },
    _ => {}
}
```

Now each match arm has no trailing expression, possibly making it clearer to the
next developer that we didn't intend on returning a value here from the match block.

Is this implementation *more* idiomatic? I'm not entirely convinced.

## More feedback

There are 2 reasons that I'm not sure about this piece of feedback.

1: Rust makes heavy use of pattern matching, and whilst `match` is technically an expression
itself (and therefore can be used as a value), I don't think it's an issue if it's not *always* used as a value?.

2: It seems like it would be more of an issue if each arm of the match had different semantics -
for example if one arm returned a value and another didn't. This would make the implementation inconsistent,
and the viewpoint may hold more water, but Rust's type system will not allow this anyway since each
arm of the `match` *must* return the same value.

For those 2 reasons, the rest of this post will focus on further improving our algorithm
to fully utilize `match` - but please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shaneOsbourne) if you disagree, I'd love
to continue the conversation üòÄ

## A new Baseline

### Improvement 1: Removing the `Option`

Our algorithm is searching within a slice of `i32` values. On each iteration we are accessing a value from the slice
with the `.get()` method. This was done for safety since a runtime panic can occur if you attempt
an index access with an out-of-bounds value.

```rust
fn this_will_panic() {
    let items = vec![10, 40, 90];
    let forth_item = items[3];
    println!("{:?}", forth_item)
    // 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds:
    // the len is 3 but the index is 3'
}
```

```rust
fn this_will_not_panic() {
    let items = vec![10, 40, 90];
    let first_item = items.get(0);
    println!("{:?}", first_item);
    // prints `Some(10)`
    let forth_item = items.get(3);
    println!("{:?}", forth_item)
    // prints `None`
}
```

So the second way of accessing a value may be safer, but it comes at the cost of an additional layer
of indirection in the form of that `Option` type.

```rust
// return type is Option<i32>
let item = items.get(4)

// return type is i32, but may panic
let item = items[4]
```

This affected our algorithm in the [first article](/blog/binary-search-rust) since we needed to use an `if let`
expression to expose the current value via the `Some(current)` pattern.

```rust
//     ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì
if let Some(current) = items.get(middle) {
    if *current == k {
        // snip
    }
    if *current > k {
        // snip
    }
    if *current < k {
        // snip
    }
}
```

So, to remove the `Option` and therefore also remove `.get()` and `Some(current)`, we'd need to be mathematically
sure to be within the slice bounds - otherwise we'd get a runtime panic! Well it turns out that our original
algorithm was actually doing all the checks we need - it always ensures the next index access is above zero and is below
the max length of the slice.

This means, in terms of the original article, we could've replaced the `if let Some(current)` with a simple index
access which makes the solution less syntactically noisy and is just simpler overall.

```rust
// we know this won't panic since we control 'middle'
//            ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì
let current = items[middle]
if current == k {
   // snip
}
```

Now we're confident that a direct index access is always safe, since we control the `middle` value - but how does
this help us with the match expression mentioned previously?

## Improvement 2: Making the comparison only once

If all we did was take the `match` expression from the beginning of this article, and remove the `Option` as mentioned
above, we'd end up with something that looked like this

```rust
// before
match items.get(middle) {
    Some(current) if *current == k => return Some(middle),
    Some(current) if *current > k => {
        if middle == 0 { return None };
        high = middle - 1
    },
    Some(current) if *current < k => { low = middle + 1; },
    _ => {}
}

// after
match items[middle] {
    current if current == k => { return Some(middle); },
    current if *current > k => {
        if middle == 0 { return None };
        high = middle - 1
    },
    current if *current < k => { low = middle + 1; },
    _ => {}
}
```

Which is barely even an improvement üôÅ, but it's missing the big next step - which is another move towards
more idiomatic Rust - and that's to take advantage of the fact that the `Ord` trait is implemented for
`i32` in the standard library (along with a few other number types).

The `Ord` trait has a `.cmp(other)` method which returns a variant of the `Ordering` enum, it's definition
looks like this...

```rust
// std::cmp
pub trait Ord: Eq + PartialOrd<Self> {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;
    // snip
}
```

... and an example in isolation would look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let first: i32 = 1;
    let second: i32 = 3;
    let result = first.cmp(&second);
    println!("result = {}", result)
    // outputs `Less`, `Greater` or `Equal` respectively
}
```

Notice how this is consolidating 3 separate comparisons into a single method call -
it removes the need to manually check `equal`, `greater`, and `less` in an imperative style and instead it ends
up being more *declarative* since we're no longer defining the actual implementation.

After the call to `.cmp(other)` we now have a value which is equal to one of `Ordering`'s 3 enum variants
and this is where languages with Pattern Matching really shine, since we can do a match on the variant and
greatly simplify our code.

```rust
match items[middle].cmp(&k) {
    Equal => return Some(middle),
    Greater => {
        if middle == 0 { return None };
        high = middle - 1
    },
    Less => low = middle + 1
}
```

Along with being a more declarative style, it's also much and less noisy with far fewer things to mentally parse. üòá

Also, since the matching on the `Ordering` enum is exhaustive, we no-longer need
the empty `_ => {}` as a final catch-all match arm either. üôè

A final thing to note here is that since we're invoking a method implemented for the `Ord` trait, it means that
our algorithm could be made more generic in the future to include searching for any type that implements `Ord`, and
not just `i32` as in our example.
